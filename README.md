# RSVP Speed Reader

## Description

RSVP Speed Reader is an AutoHotkey script that implements a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) technique for speed reading. This tool allows users to input text and display it word by word or in small chunks at a configurable speed, potentially increasing reading speed and comprehension.

## Features

- **Customizable Speed**: Set your desired reading speed in words per minute (WPM).
- **Adjustable Chunk Size**: Choose to display single words or multiple words at a time.
- **Dynamic Chunking**: Automatically adjusts chunk size based on punctuation for a more natural reading flow.
- **Intuitive Controls**: Start, stop, and navigate through the text with easy-to-use buttons.
- **Responsive Display**: Large, centered text for comfortable reading.
- **Punctuation Pauses**: Automatically adds slight pauses at the end of sentences and for other punctuation marks.

## Requirements

- [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) v1.1 or later

## Installation

1. Install AutoHotkey if you haven't already.
2. Download the `RVSP vX.X.ahk` script.

## Usage

1. Launch the script to open the RSVP Speed Reader GUI.
